# Number game

To solve this challenge we can use the [pwntools library](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/tubes/ssh.html) to connect to the game and use a simple [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) to find the number.

The file in code.py in this folder solves the challenge when run.
