We are given a punch card in this challenge. Punch cards where a way of encoding and storing code to be run on computers before non-volatile memory. We can use [this site](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/codes.html) to decode each line, [this tutorial](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-read-a-punch-card) was helpful as well. We can use [this site](http://www.kloth.net/services/cardpunch.php) to check our answer.
