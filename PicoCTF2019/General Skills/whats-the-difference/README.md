#### Can you spot the difference? [kitters](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/473cf765877f28edf95140f90cd76b59/kitters.jpg) [cattos](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/473cf765877f28edf95140f90cd76b59/cattos.jpg). They are also available at /problems/whats-the-difference_0_00862749a2aeb45993f36cc9cf98a47a on the shell server

To find the difference we first create a hex dump of both files. Then we use the diff command on both of them to reveal the differences. 
After joining together all the differences we find the flag.
