#### I wrote you a [song](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/200c6d216520c81a66af2c005736ae85/lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format

This is a program in the esoteric programming langugae [Rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar). We can use [this online compiler](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) to run the code.
The code outputs a series of numbers which when converted to ascii results in the flag.

Flag: picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
