#### If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

This problem can be solved through an [ascii lookup table](http://www.asciitable.com/), [online converters](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html) or python
```
>>> chr(0x70)
'p'
```
