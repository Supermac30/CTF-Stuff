Trying to input `' or 1=1--` doesn't work this time. When sending a request now we can see from the network panel that there is also a debug parameter being sent. Using firefox we can change it to 1 by right clicking the form and clicking edit and resend.
We then see that the request being made changes 'or' to 'be'. Trying the password `' be 1=1--` results in the flag.
