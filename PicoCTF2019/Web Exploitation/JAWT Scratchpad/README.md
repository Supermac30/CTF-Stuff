# JAWT Scratchpad
#### Check the admin scratchpad! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12283/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12283

After signing in with any username we see a JWT cookie being stored. Decoding it [here](https://jwt.io/) we see that it holds the current user.
To creack the secret key we can try a dictionary attack. Using the [rockyou.txt file](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt)
and [a cracking tool](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool) we find that the secret key is ilovepico. Using [this site again](https://jwt.io), we can 
change the value of the user in the payload to admin and insert ilovepico as the secret key to get the admin's session cookie.

```
Changing the cookie to this and refreshing we get the flag.
