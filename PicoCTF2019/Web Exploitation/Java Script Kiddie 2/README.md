# Java Script Kiddie 2

This is practically the same problem as [Java Script Kiddie](https://github.com/Supermac30/PicoCTF-2019/tree/master/Web%20Exploitation/Java%20Script%20Kiddie).
This time, however, the values of the bytes are different and the input is handled differently.

The input has to be 32 characters long. Looking at the source we see this line `shifter = Number(key.slice((i*2),(i*2)+1));`. 
At first I thought that this time the number is two digits long. I spent a good few hours staring at the code wondering why nothing was working.
Looking back at this line we can see that, annoyingly, this line just takes every even character. Lesson learnt: always test your basic
assumptions.

Anyway, this problem can be solved in almost exactly the same way as before, just with a few adjustments to the code. I was getting repeated
outputs when running the code so I added a test to check if the possibility was printed before.

Trying the possibilities, it doesn't take long to get to one that works:
```
80802090204020407030306000408060
```
