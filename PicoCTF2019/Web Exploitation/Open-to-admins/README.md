# Open-to-admins
#### This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49858/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:49858

Entering the site all we see is a button with the word flag. The website has to have a way to authenticate the user. Adding a cookie with the value True for admin and 1400 for time results in the flag.

Flag: picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_effb525e}
