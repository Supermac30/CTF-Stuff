#### Login as admin. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47283/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47283

I solved this after the competition ended.

Looking at the web page all we can see is a login page without a clear vulnerability. Trying out common password and username combinations,
however, can log us in when the username and password are both 'guest'.

Logged in we can see that the file in the url changes to regular_user. Trying out some common path names leads us to the admin page. Sadly,
the page has no useful information. All it does it tell us we are not admin.

Looking at the network panel we can see that in the loading of this page the website requests a cookie named user_info. Examining this closer,
we can see that it is a base64 encoded string. Decoding this we get `O:11:"permissions":2:{s:8:"username";s:5:"guest";s:8:"password";s:5:"guest";}`. This took me a long time to get, annoyingly, but the numbers in the cookie 
hold the length of the string. We can try a simple SQL injection here changing the cookie to this instead:
```
O:11:"permissions":2:{s:8:"username";s:16:"admin' or '1'='1";s:8:"password";s:1:" ";}
```
Doing this and refreshing results in the flag.
