#### Psst, Agent 513, now that you're an employee of Evil Empire Co., try to get their secrets off the company website. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/45012/Can you first find the secret code they assigned to you? or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:45012

After logging in and looking around we see that the website is mostly plain, except for the create todo page. User input is always the place that is most vulnerable.
Playing around with the input we find that inserting a `'` breaks the site, there must be some SQL involved. Looking at what is going on more closely
we see that the website must be using an [INSERT INTO](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert.asp) statement. This is easily exploitable when there doesn't exist any input sanitation.

The insert into statement must look something like this `INSERT INTO todo (todos) VALUES ('USER INPUT')`. This means we can turn the command into something like this
`INSERT INTO todo (todos) VALUES (''|| (EVIL COMMAND) ||'')` to get to where we are not supposed to. The table name is easy to guess, it turns out to be user.
Inputting a select statement to select the secret from our user name would result in the flag. Something like this will do:

```
' || (SELECT secret FROM user WHERE username='your_user_name') || '
```
