# logon
#### The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47307/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47307

Looking at the sign in page we see that anyone except admin can login with any password. Logging in and looking at the request in the
network panel we see that the site checks the value of the cookie admin from False to True then resending the requests results in the flag.
