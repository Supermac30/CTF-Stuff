Whenever starting any web exploitation challenge always look through the source. We can find the flag segmented in comments in the html, css, and javascript files.
```
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```
```
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```
```
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?d3db9182} */
```
