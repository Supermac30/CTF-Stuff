A caeser cipher is a substitution cipher which shifts each letter a certain number of times to the right. 
For example a caeser cipher of shift 2 turns an A into a C. A caeser cipher of shift 13 is also known as a ROT13 cipher. An online decoder, 
[like this one](https://rot13.com/), can do this for us.
