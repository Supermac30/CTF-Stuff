# GoT
#### You can only change one address, here is the problem: [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/50e3e3de100ade32e3602c23c76fda64/vuln). It is also found in /problems/got_0_4521f0cfb186aab8acc47d9abe572bdb on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/50e3e3de100ade32e3602c23c76fda64/vuln.c).

To solve this problem we can replace the address of exit in in the [global offset table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Offset_Table) with the address of the win function.
To find the address of exit and win in the GOT we can use the python script above in this repository.
```
