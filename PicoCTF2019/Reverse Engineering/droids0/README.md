#### Where do droid logs go. Check out this [file](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/fab5805be31eb4c802d0fdc711a1898d/zero.apk). You can also find the file in /problems/droids0_0_205f7b4a3b23490adffddfcfc45a2ca3.

To solve this problem all we have to do is run the apk file in an emulator or on your phone. We can do this with Android Studio. After sending input we can see the flag pop up in the logs.
