# vault-door-7
#### This vault uses bit shifts to convert a password string into an array of integers. Hurry, agent, we are running out of time to stop Dr. Evil's nefarious plans! The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor7.java](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/9fc4e47b7a5f925b7f7230b4b3ef2d90/VaultDoor7.java)

To solve this problem we have to convert the integers to binary then concatinate them to finally convert them to the ascii value they represent. We can do this with the script above.
